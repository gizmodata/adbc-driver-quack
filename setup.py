setup.py for the adbc-driver-quack Python wheel.

The Go-built c-shared library must be copied into the package source
tree before the wheel is built. The path to the library is passed
via the ``ADBC_QUACK_LIBRARY`` environment variable, mirroring the
adbc-driver-flightsql convention.

Lives at the repo root (not under python/) so the PyPI README can
just be ``README.md`` — no parent-directory reference or mirror dance.
